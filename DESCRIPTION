Package: bangladesh
Title: Provides ready to use shapefiles for geographical map of Bangladesh
Description: This package aims to provide ready-to-use shapefiles for different administrative 
    regions of Bangladesh (e.g., Division, District, Upazila, and Union). 
    Usually, it is difficult to plot choropleth maps for Bangladesh in R. 
    This package will help users to draw thematic maps of administrative regions 
    of Bangladesh easily as it comes with the sf objects for the boundaries and 
    regionsâ€™ names in English. It also provides functions allowing users to efficiently
    get specific area maps and center coordinates for regions. Users can also search for
    a specific area and calculate the centroids of those areas.
