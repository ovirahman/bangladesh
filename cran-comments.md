## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have addressed all the comments:

* Size of tarball: further reduced to 4.28 MB. This package depends on datasets so please consider
* The Description field no longer starts with  'This package' or similar.
* Single quotes used for 'bangladesh', 'R', 'sf'
* Checked description field for blank spaces
* \value added to all function documentations 
* TRUE and FALSE used instead of T and F
* Small executable examples used in Rd-files
